# Custom Children's Book
<h3>This folder contains all files necessary to create a custom children's book. This is my final project for my Object Oriented Programming class at Southwest Tech.</h3>
<p>This program works in two parts. The first part is to gather custimazation information from the user. This is done through a GUI created using JavaFX.</p>
